experiment3b
- results written up in paper
- continuous covariates, discretised into 5 categories
- bernoulli model, leave ONE out

**3c
- exactly same as 3b but with different seed to validate results

experiment4
- same population as 3c
- binomial model, leave one CELL out

experiment4a 
- same as experiment4, but include saving model estimates

experiment4b 
- trying different seed as in exp**3c 

experiment5a
- generating strong reln of X4 and outcome and 
- use AR(1) prior
- fx1

experiment5b
- same as exp**5a
- fx2 as reln

experiment5c 
- same as exp**5a
- fx3 as reln

experiment6*
- using K=12 for categories of X4 to reduce run time 
- still using flat prior

experiment6*4
- changed the AR prior models specification (was using (1|X4) in the model statement, did not need that)

experiment6*5
- changed to using 2 cores to see if it speeds up

experiment6*6
- changed sample size to 1000 

experiment6z*
- copy of exp__6a* to test number of cores and cpu settings 

experiment7*
- changed to Normal prior for AR terms 

experiment8*
- writing Rstan code for our AR models 
- first running it locally then try it on cluster
- cutting down to six models under our original four groups
