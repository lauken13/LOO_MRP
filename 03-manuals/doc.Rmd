This document will describe the simulations we plan to conduct and the expected results from using `loo` and `weighted_loo` to do model comparisons. 

Say we have a simple case of two predictor variables, $X_1$ and $X_2$ and an outcome $Y$. Lets suppose:

\

<center>
$X_1 \xrightarrow{\text{strongly predictive}} Y$

$X_2 \xrightarrow{\text{weakly predictive}} Y$
</center>

\ 

Both $X_1$ and $X_2$ were sampled unevenly from the population, which gives us strong indication for incorporating inclusion probability in our models. 

If we ran three different models (in `R` syntax):

1) $Y \sim X_1 + X_2$
2) $Y \sim X_1$
3) $Y \sim X_2$

We would expect model 1) to give us the highest _elpd_ value, followed by 2) and 3). In the case of using weighted loo's, we should expect it would give us similar results too.
