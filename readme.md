# LOO_MRP experiments
 
## 01-finite-popn approach

We started with a finite population approach, but we were getting mixed results. So we moved on to a super population approach by sampling a different population each time. (see /manuals/doc_2.html)

## 02-super-popn approach
 
### experiment1  
bernoulli model for individual (leave-one-out)

### experiment2 
trialling binomial model (leave-one-GROUP/CELL-out rather than individual)

### experiment3
- trying AR prior on X4 
- X4 set to have different relationships with the outcome
  - fx1 (smiley face reln. with the outcome)
  - fx2 (sad face reln. ")
  - fx3 (increasing-shaped reln. ")

## manuals 
- `doc_1.html` - describes the design of the variables set up for all the simulations we run 

- `doc_2.html` - describes all the simulation settings we ran
  1) Finite population approach
  2) Super population approach
